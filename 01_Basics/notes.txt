----JavaScript is a dynamically typed language, 
which means that data types of variables are determined by the value they hold at runtime and can change throughout the program as we assign different values to them

const score = 100

in which we are not defining score is int or string , we can also have 
const score = "100"



----typeof datatypes
1. undefined   =  undefined
2. null        =  object
3.Boolean       =   Boolean
4.Number        =   Number
5.String        =   String
6.object        =   object
7.object call   =   function
8.Array         =   object

-----Stack and Heap memory
Stack
Primitive data types and references
Size is known at compile time
Fixed memory allocated
copy is created

Heap
Objects and functions
Size is known at run time
No limit for object memory
actual references
